            <li>A computer keyboard is a peripheral input device.</li>
            <li>Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have a set of characters engraved or printed on them,<br>and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol.</li>
            <li>The interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software:<br>the information sent to the computer, the scan code, tells it only which physical key<br>(or keys) was pressed or released.</li>
            <li>Touchscreens use virtual keyboards.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 style="text-indent: 2%">HISTORY OF KEYBOARD:</h1>
        <ul style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium">
            <li> As early as the 1870s, teleprinter-like devices were used to simultaneously type<br>and transmit stock market text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to stock<br>ticker machines.</li>
            <li>The keyboard remained the primary, most integrated computer peripheral well into era<br>of personal computing until the introduction of the mouse as consumer device in 1984.</li>
            <li>keyboards remain central to human-computer interaction to the present though mobile<br>personal computing devices such as smartphones and tablets use a virtual keyboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 style="text-indent: 2%">TECHNOLOGY:</h1>
        <ul style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium">   
            <li>In the first electronic keyboards in the early 1970s, the key switches were individual<br>switches inserted into holes in metal frames.</li>
            <li>In the mid-1970s, lower-cost direct-contact key switches were introduced.</li>
            <li>In 1978, Key Tronic Corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive-based switches,<br>one of the first keyboard technologies not to use self-contained switches.</li>
            <li>In common use, the term "mechanical keyboard" refers to a keyboard with individual<br>mechanical key switches.</li>
